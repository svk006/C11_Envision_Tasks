### **Short note on CSV vs Parquet**

**CSV**  
- It is in text format and is human readable.  
- Due to its text format, it has a larger file size and slower performance.  
- It is best used in small-scale data processing.

**Parquet**  
- It is in binary format and hence not human readable.  
- It has a smaller file size along with faster and more efficient performance.  
- It is best used in large-scale data processing.
