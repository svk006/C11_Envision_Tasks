write here what you understood from each task, challenges faced if any

## Task 2a
- Understood the working and mathematics behing the linear regression algorithm and learnt how to train a regression model using the given dataset.
-  Explored different errors and R^2 score.
-  Faced a little bit of difficulty in reducing the error (overfitting of data) but understood how to do it in the end.

## Task 2b
- Understood terms like likelihood, similarity between different linear models, and logistic regression that predicts probabilities using sigmoid function.

## Task 2c
- Worked with the wine dataset and selected three features based on correlation. Looked into correlation matrix and Variance Inflation Factor to determine similar colums.
- Faced challenges while trying choose a method for scalar multiple.
- Also as this is a dataset which is best suited for logistic regression, it was difficult to achieve a linear regression model which predicted accurately

## Task 2d
- Created new branch in fun, inserted favson.txt and merged it with fun branch.
